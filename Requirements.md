**Project Requirement Document**

**Project Title:** AWS Solution Architect Agent

**Objective:**
Develop an AI-powered agent capable of designing AWS-based solutions, generating architecture diagrams, customizing solutions based on user inputs, and evaluating existing architectures for improvements in line with the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

---

## **1. Scope of the Project**
### **1.1 Core Capabilities**
- Build AWS service-based solutions based on user requirements.
- Generate architecture diagrams dynamically.
- Customize architectural solutions based on user-provided inputs.
- Understand and implement AWS best practices, including Multi-Region deployments, Disaster Recovery (DR), Scalability, Operational Excellence, Cost Optimization, Security, Reliability, Performance, Design for Failure, and Automation.
- Ask relevant follow-up questions to refine solution accuracy.
- Provide alternative architecture solutions with pros and cons.
- Analyze existing architecture designs (including image inputs) to suggest improvements based on AWS best practices.

### **1.2 AI Model Requirements**
- Select or fine-tune an LLM with extensive knowledge of:
  - AWS Well-Architected Framework.
  - All AWS services, their descriptions, and use cases.
  - General architecture patterns and best practices.

---

## **2. Functional Requirements**
### **2.1 Solution Generation**
- Accept user inputs specifying requirements, constraints, and preferences.
- Understand AWS principles such as cost efficiency, scalability, and security.
- Dynamically generate an AWS architecture diagram with labeled components.
- Provide a textual explanation of the proposed solution.
- Offer alternative solutions with comparative advantages.

### **2.2 User Interaction & Query Handling**
- Use a conversational interface for requirement gathering.
- Ask clarifying questions if user input is incomplete or ambiguous.
- Provide explanations for design decisions, referencing AWS best practices.

### **2.3 Architecture Analysis & Recommendations**
- Accept architecture diagrams as image input.
- Analyze the architecture and detect potential design flaws.
- Recommend improvements aligned with AWS Well-Architected Framework.

---

## **3. Technical Requirements**
### **3.1 AI Model & Knowledge Base**
- Use an LLM with AWS-specific training or fine-tune an existing model.
- Integrate a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to access updated AWS documentation.
- Store AWS architecture patterns in a structured knowledge base.

### **3.2 System Components**
- **LLM-Based Agent:** Processes user queries and generates solutions.
- **Diagram Generation Engine:** Converts text-based architecture to visuals.
- **Architecture Analyzer:** Uses vision models to assess existing designs.
- **Alternative Solutions Module:** Suggests multiple design options.

### **3.3 Deployment & Integration**
- Deploy as a web-based application or chatbot.
- Integrate with AWS services (e.g., SageMaker, Bedrock) for AI processing.
- Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates (CloudFormation, Terraform) to automate deployment of recommended solutions.

---

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- Ensure security by following AWS IAM best practices.
- Provide responses within an acceptable latency for real-time interactions.
- Maintain an up-to-date knowledge base with evolving AWS services and best practices.
- Implement logging and monitoring for debugging and usage analytics.

---

## **5. Next Steps**
- Select an LLM model with AWS expertise.
- Define system architecture and required integrations.
- Break down requirements into specific development tasks.
- Develop and test the solution in an iterative manner.
